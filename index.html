            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am an <em>International Student</em> at <strong>Algonquin College</strong>, currently taking up <strong>Interactive Media Design.</strong> I am from The Philippines. However, I was working full time as a Senior Graphic Designer within several companies in Dubai, <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr> since 2006. I arrived here in Canada last 24<sup>th</sup> April 2023 together with my family and we find Ottawa amazing.</p>

            <p>I am excited to be back in school, my favorite thing to do in class is to listen to the lessons carefully and interact with my fellow classmates. I took up this program as I believe it is the future of the design industry and it will open up many opportunities, advancements in my chosen career and add value to my personal development. Five years from now, I see myself to be successfully managing a team in a creative environment or looking after a business of my own.</p>

            <p>I am into events photography, and also I did some hobbies like offroading/dune bashing, back when we were in Dubai. </p>
